                <h2>Drowned Gods</h2>
                <p>Dwelling below the waves, these monoliths hold domain over a single layer each. Though they are sleeping, their will is manifested and carried out by an avatar of themselves. Were they to wake... no soul would live to tell of it.</p>

                <h3>Yun'Shul, Keeper of Hearts</h3>
                <p>Drowned God of Scyphozia, the First Layer. Said to hold power over souls and grant the wishes of mortals. Also said to facilitate passage between Lumen and the Depths, including the former's sinking into the latter. Those in its domain are known to suffer several psychological phenomena such as paranoia, hallucinations, and insanity.</p>

            <div class="resource-item">
                <h3>Ethiron, Eye of Calamity</h3>
                <p>Very few know of its existence, and even fewer have witnessed its effects. It resides in the Second Layer, the Eternal Gale. From what little information the Divers were willing to make public, it can be assumed that its domain creates harsh winds and possibly time distortion as well. The reason behind the scarcity of information about Ethiron and the Second Layer is the danger that exploring the Depths, let alone a foreign layer, entails.</p>

                <h2>Celestials</h2>
                <p>The people of the stars. Worshipped by many, their cities dot the night sky like stars. During the Canticlysm, they fell from their ivory towers to the surface which caused great changes in the world and many new religions to sprout.</p>

                <h3>Navae, Goddess of Frost</h3>
                <p>A Celestial who fell from Constellia and was nursed back to health by a Gremorian nomad. In return, she made a hereditary vow with them that would bestow her guidance onto their offspring, resulting in the formation of the Children of Navae tribe/religion.</p>

                <p>Another Celestial from Constellia who fell upon the Songseeker Wilds, corrupting the landscape. "Worshipped" by the Starkindred, if you can call it that. A minor deity thought to embody travel and flight.</p>

                <p>The Kingdom of Etrea is a noble and powerful faction known for its use of Galebreathe and mastery of swordsmanship.
