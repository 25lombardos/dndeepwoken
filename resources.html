                <h2>Drowned Gods</h2>
                <p>Dwelling below the waves, these monoliths hold domain over a single layer each. Though they are sleeping, their will is manifested and carried out by an avatar of themselves. Were they to wake... no soul would live to tell of it.</p>

                <h3>Yun'Shul, Keeper of Hearts</h3>
                <p>Drowned God of Scyphozia, the First Layer. Said to hold power over souls and grant the wishes of mortals. Also said to facilitate passage between Lumen and the Depths, including the former's sinking into the latter. Those in its domain are known to suffer several psychological phenomena such as paranoia, hallucinations, and insanity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="resource-item">
                <h3>Ethiron, Eye of Calamity</h3>
                <p>Very few know of its existence, and even fewer have witnessed its effects. It resides in the Second Layer, the Eternal Gale. From what little information the Divers were willing to make public, it can be assumed that its domain creates harsh winds and possibly time distortion as well. The reason behind the scarcity of information about Ethiron and the Second Layer is the danger that exploring the Depths, let alone a foreign layer, entails.</p>

                <p>The people of the stars. Worshipped by many, their cities dot the night sky like stars. During the Canticlysm, they fell from their ivory towers to the surface which caused great changes in the world and many new religions to sprout.</p>

                <h3>Navae, Goddess of Frost</h3>
                <p>A Celestial who fell from Constellia and was nursed back to health by a Gremorian nomad. In return, she made a hereditary vow with them that would bestow her guidance onto their offspring, resulting in the formation of the Children of Navae tribe/religion.</p>

                <h3>The Kingdom of Etrea</h2>
                <p>The Kingdom of Etrea is a noble and powerful faction known for its use of Galebreathe and mastery of swordsmanship. It is the main ruling faction in the Etrean Luminant, with its capital being Etris. They are currently at war with the Central Authority. Traditionally ruled by a lineage of kings, but is currently ruled by the Lord Regent who only recently rose to power. Primarily composed of Etreans.</p>

                <img class="resource-thumb" src="images/AuthoritySymbol.png" height="85px" width="85px">
                <h3>The Central Authority</h2>
                <p>An authoritative and militaristic faction present throughout Lumen. Ruled by the iron-fisted Grand Sovereign Drallis Ehr. Though their capital, Markor, is in the Central luminant, their influence stretches far beyond it. They have been at war with Etris since the Lord Regent rose to power. Adret and Canor are considered a higher class of citizens and they make up most of the higher ranks of the military.</p>

                <h3>The Ignition Union</h2>
                <p>A mining company contracted by the Central Authority. Currently tasked with recovering valuable resources and artifacts from the depths and its layers. They are adept with technology and mechanical engineering. Their capital, Miner's Landing, is found in the Eastern Luminant, but they have outposts elsewhere, including the first and second layers of the Depths. They compete aggressively with the Divers despite them both being contracted by the Authority.</p>

                <h3>The Divers</h2>
                <p>A research and exploration organization focused on the Depths. Contracted by the Authority along with the Ignition Union. They possess possibly the most advanced arcane knowledge throughout Lumen and the Depths. Their capital is Markor Citadel in Markor, but their main base of operations is Castle Light in Scyphozia.</p>

                <h3>The Hive</h2>
                <p>A somewhat reclusive society of builders and scholars with multiple territories scattered around Lumen. Their mastery of Lifeweave magic has allowed them to become architects of unsurpassed skill. Their goal is to create more land to stave off the coming of the Tides, and as such they live in giant tree structures called Greathives created from Lifeweave. Their members consist of Hivekin, that being the insect-derived races of Vesperians, Ganymedes, and Chrysid.</p>
